    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p class="nottime">My objective is to translate and apply the skills I've acquired as a diligent educator, into a
        dynamic new career in full stack web development. Achievement will be earned through the utilization of
        passionate focus on constant self improvement, by adapting to fit industry needs and evolving standards, and by
        facing all obstacles along the way with creative and abstract critical thinking until a solution is determined.
