        <p>I was born in the late evening hours of one August 23rd day, and it's pretty much all been downhill from there. <br></p>

        <p>Since finding a free community music program for children in the summer of 1999, I've been a musician and
           dedicated my life to studying drums and percussion. Over the years I got to play with amazing artists, record for bands
           at state of the art studios, play in front of big crowds, and none of that mattered one bit to me compared to how much
           I truly loved learning how to get better and take my art to the next level all by myself. <br></p>

        <p>It wasn't until I became a Father that I realized the downfalls of living a life without planning for the 
           future. I found myself overwhelmed and afraid of not being able to provide the life my children deserve, 
           and watch them suffer because of my poor choices. It was time to make a change.<br></p>

        <p>After owning my own private music lesson business while also working a second full-time job I found myself working 75+ hours a week.
           I could barely make ends meet all while I missed out on being present with my family for the vast majority of the time.
           I was given the biggest oppertunity of my life. I had the chance to reinvent myself, to give my family a better life while also
           having a work-life balance that meant I could be there with my wife and children to experience the irreplaceble moments that I was once
           in danger of not being a part of.<br></p>
